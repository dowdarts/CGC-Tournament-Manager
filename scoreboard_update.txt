lets create our own scoreboard for live streams that would update real time from the dartconnect live match the scrapper would scrape the input scores from the match and update the throw turn and the score of each opponent that i can embed on my live stream

Building a custom, real-time scoreboard for DartConnect requires a two-part approach: a Scraper/Backend to fetch the data and a Web Overlay to display it in OBS or your streaming software.

Because DartConnect TV (DCTV) uses a dynamic web interface, a simple "static" scraper won't work. You'll need a tool that can "see" the page like a human does.

Phase 1: The Tech Stack
Node.js & Puppeteer: Puppeteer is a "headless browser" that will open DartConnect in the background, allow you to log in (if needed), and read the live HTML elements as they change.

Socket.io: This will "push" the data from your scraper to your scoreboard overlay instantly without refreshing.

HTML/CSS/JS: To build the actual visual scoreboard you'll see on stream.

Phase 2: The Scraper Logic
The scraper needs to target the DCTV Live Scoreboard URL for your specific match.

Launch Puppeteer: Open the match URL.

Target the Selectors: You'll need to inspect the DCTV page to find the specific HTML classes for:

#player1_score, #player2_score (The points remaining)

.current_turn (To see who is throwing)

.last_throw (To show the 140, 100, 60, etc.)

Monitor Changes: Use a MutationObserver or a simple interval loop (e.g., every 500ms) to check if the text inside those classes has changed.

Phase 3: The Scoreboard Overlay (HTML/CSS)
You can design this to look exactly how you want. Since you are embedding it as a Browser Source in OBS:

Use a transparent background (background: rgba(0,0,0,0);).

Create containers for Player 1 and Player 2.

Add "animations" using CSS transitions so the score doesn't just "jump" but fades or slides when it updates.

Basic Code Structure (Conceptual)
1. The Scraper (app.js)
JavaScript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const io = require('socket.io')(3000); // Send data to overlay

async function watchMatch(url) {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto(url);

    setInterval(async () => {
        const matchData = await page.evaluate(() => {
            return {
                p1Score: document.querySelector('.p1-score-class').innerText,
                p2Score: document.querySelector('.p2-score-class').innerText,
                activePlayer: document.querySelector('.active-indicator').getAttribute('data-player')
            };
        });
        io.emit('updateScore', matchData);
    }, 1000);
}
2. The Overlay (index.html)
HTML
<div id="scoreboard">
  <div id="p1-display">501</div>
  <div id="p2-display">501</div>
</div>

<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');
  socket.on('updateScore', (data) => {
    document.getElementById('p1-display').innerText = data.p1Score;
    document.getElementById('p2-display').innerText = data.p2Score;
    // Add logic to highlight the active player
  });
</script>
Why not use DartConnect's built-in TV Widget?
DartConnect actually offers a TV Scoreboard Widget (found in their menu) designed for OBS. It is very reliable, but it is not customizable in terms of layout/branding. Building your own gives you:

Custom fonts and colors.

Lower-third animations.

Integration with your own stream alerts.

Important Note on Performance
Scraping can be resource-heavy. If you are streaming and scraping on the same PC, ensure you run Puppeteer in headless: true mode to save CPU/GPU for your game and broadcast.

Would you like me to help you find the specific CSS selectors for the current DartConnect TV layout so we can refine the scraper code?

yes and because you can only use tv scoreboard when you purchuse a digital steel event it wont let you use the score board for regualer matches

That makes total sense. DartConnect hides the "TV Scoreboard" feature behind the Digital Steel paywall, which is frustrating if you're just trying to run a standard league night or a friendly match.

To bypass this, we can scrape the DCTV (DartConnect TV) fan view. This is the free "Live Match" page that anyone can view to follow a match.

1. The Target URL
Instead of the scoring app, we will scrape the public "Live Match" page. It usually looks like this: https://tv.dartconnect.com/match/[MATCH_ID]

2. Identifying the CSS Selectors
DartConnect uses a lot of dynamic IDs. Based on their current web structure, here are the selectors we need for our scraper:

Data Point	CSS Selector (Target)	Notes
P1 Score	#p1_score	The large remaining total (e.g., 501).
P2 Score	#p2_score	The opponent's remaining total.
Active Turn	.active-player	Usually a class added to the name or score box.
Last Throw	#last_throw or .score-entry	Shows the 3-dart total just entered.
Legs/Sets	.leg-score, .set-score	To track the overall match progress.
3. Creating the Scraper (Node.js + Puppeteer)
This script will act as your "middleman." It opens the match in a hidden window and sends updates to your scoreboard.

JavaScript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const io = require('socket.io')(3000); // Sends data to your HTML overlay

async function startScraper(matchUrl) {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: "new" });
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto(matchUrl);

    console.log("Monitoring match...");

    setInterval(async () => {
        const data = await page.evaluate(() => {
            // This runs inside the DartConnect page
            return {
                p1Name: document.querySelector('#p1_name')?.innerText || "Player 1",
                p2Name: document.querySelector('#p2_name')?.innerText || "Player 2",
                p1Score: document.querySelector('#p1_score')?.innerText || "501",
                p2Score: document.querySelector('#p2_score')?.innerText || "501",
                isP1Turn: document.querySelector('#p1_row').classList.contains('active'),
                lastThrow: document.querySelector('.last-throw-area')?.innerText || ""
            };
        });

        io.emit('scoreUpdate', data);
    }, 500); // Check every half-second for zero-lag updates
}

startScraper('PASTE_YOUR_DCTV_URL_HERE');
4. Designing Your Overlay (HTML/CSS)
Since you are no longer limited by DartConnect's "TV Widget," you can make this look like a professional PDC broadcast.

Scannability: Put the scores in large, bold numbers.

Active Indicator: Use a simple JavaScript if statement to add a "glow" or an arrow next to the player whose turn it is.

OBS Setup: Add a Browser Source in OBS pointing to http://localhost:3000.

Why this works better than "Window Capture"
Transparency: You can make the background invisible so only the scores sit over your camera feed.

Branding: You can add your own logos, sponsor scrolls, or social media handles.

Stability: Window captures often break if you resize the window; a scraper just looks for the data in the code.

Would you like me to write a complete, styled HTML/CSS template for the scoreboard that you can use immediately with this scraper?

https://tv.dartconnect.com/live/[watchcode] is the dart connect livr match url.. yes lets build id like it to be hosted on gitpage and backed up on supabase to feed the info back to the score board

This is a great architectural choice. Since GitHub Pages only hosts static files (HTML/JS), using Supabase as the "engine" is perfect. Supabase will handle the real-time data "broadcast" from your local scraper to your public-facing scoreboard.

Here is the blueprint for your custom live-stream scoreboard.

1. The Architecture
The Scraper (Local): A small Node.js script running on your PC. It scrapes the DCTV URL and "pushes" updates to Supabase.

The Database (Supabase): Acts as the bridge. We will use the Realtime Broadcast feature so data is sent instantly to any listener.

The Scoreboard (GitHub Pages): A static HTML/JS page hosted for free. It "subscribes" to your Supabase channel and updates the UI whenever new scores arrive.

2. Set Up Supabase
Create a project at Supabase.

Go to Project Settings > API and grab your Project URL and anon key.

Go to Database > Replication and ensure "Realtime" is enabled for your tables (though for this, we will use "Broadcast" which doesn't even require a table!).

3. The Local Scraper (scraper.js)
This script runs on your computer while you play/watch. It uses puppeteer to read the match and the @supabase/supabase-js library to send data.

JavaScript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');

const supabase = createClient('YOUR_SUPABASE_URL', 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY');
const channel = supabase.channel('match-updates');

async function scrapeDCTV(url) {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: "new" });
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto(url);

    setInterval(async () => {
        try {
            const matchData = await page.evaluate(() => {
                // Specific DCTV Selectors
                return {
                    p1Score: document.querySelector('#p1_score')?.innerText || '501',
                    p2Score: document.querySelector('#p2_score')?.innerText || '501',
                    p1Legs: document.querySelector('#p1_legs')?.innerText || '0',
                    p2Legs: document.querySelector('#p2_legs')?.innerText || '0',
                    activePlayer: document.querySelector('.active-player') ? 1 : 2, 
                    lastThrow: document.querySelector('.last-throw')?.innerText || ''
                };
            });

            // Send to Supabase via Realtime Broadcast
            channel.send({
                type: 'broadcast',
                event: 'score-change',
                payload: matchData,
            });
        } catch (e) { console.error("Scraping error:", e); }
    }, 1000);
}

scrapeDCTV('https://tv.dartconnect.com/live/YOUR_MATCH_CODE');
4. The Scoreboard (index.html)
Host this on GitHub Pages. It’s a clean, transparent overlay for OBS.

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
    <style>
        body { background: transparent; color: white; font-family: sans-serif; }
        .scoreboard { display: flex; gap: 20px; background: rgba(0,0,0,0.8); padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px; }
        .active { border-bottom: 3px solid yellow; }
        .score { font-size: 48px; font-weight: bold; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="scoreboard">
        <div id="p1-box">
            <div id="p1-score" class="score">501</div>

            <div>Legs: <span id="p2-legs">0</span></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script>
        const supabase = supabase.createClient('YOUR_SUPABASE_URL', 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY');
        const channel = supabase.channel('match-updates');

        channel.on('broadcast', { event: 'score-change' }, (payload) => {
            const data = payload.payload;
            document.getElementById('p1-score').innerText = data.p1Score;
            document.getElementById('p2-score').innerText = data.p2Score;
            document.getElementById('p1-legs').innerText = data.p1Legs;
            document.getElementById('p2-legs').innerText = data.p2Legs;
            
            // Highlight active player
            document.getElementById('p1-box').className = data.activePlayer === 1 ? 'active' : '';
            document.getElementById('p2-box').className = data.activePlayer === 2 ? 'active' : '';
        }).subscribe();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
5. Deployment to GitHub Pages
Create a new GitHub Repo (e.g., my-darts-score).

Upload the index.html file.

Go to Settings > Pages and enable deployment from the main branch.

Copy your site URL and paste it as a Browser Source in OBS.

How it looks in OBS:
Add a Browser Source.

URL: https://yourusername.github.io/my-darts-score/

Width: 800, Height: 200 (Adjust as needed).

The background will be transparent, so you can place the scoreboard anywhere over your dartboard camera.

This setup is powerful because you can also open the GitHub link on your phone to see the live scores while you're in another room!

id like to just add browser and go to the link and the score board would overlay on my screen

To achieve a "one-click" experience where you simply add a browser source link to OBS and see your live scores, we will use Supabase Realtime Broadcast. This allows your local scraper to "shout" the scores into the cloud, and your GitHub-hosted scoreboard to "hear" them and update instantly.

Phase 1: The Scoreboard (GitHub Pages)
This is the page you will add to OBS. It needs to be transparent and ready to receive data.

Create a repository on GitHub (e.g., darts-overlay).

Create an index.html file with the following code:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
    <style>
        /* Modern PDC-style Lower Third */
        body { background: transparent; color: white; font-family: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif; overflow: hidden; }
        .wrapper { display: flex; align-items: center; background: rgba(20, 20, 20, 0.9); border-left: 5px solid #00ff00; width: 600px; height: 80px; padding: 0 20px; border-radius: 0 10px 10px 0; }
        .player-section { flex: 1; display: flex; flex-direction: column; }
        .name { font-size: 18px; text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: bold; }
        .score { font-size: 40px; font-weight: 900; color: #00ff00; }
        .active { background: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2); }
        .divider { width: 2px; height: 60%; background: #444; margin: 0 15px; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <div id="p1-area" class="player-section">
            <div id="p1-name" class="name">Player 1</div>
            <div id="p1-score" class="score">501</div>
        </div>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <div id="p2-area" class="player-section">
            <div id="p2-name" class="name">Player 2</div>
            <div id="p2-score" class="score">501</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script>
        // REPLACE with your Supabase Project Details
        const supabase = supabase.createClient('https://your-project.supabase.co', 'your-anon-key');
        
        const channel = supabase.channel('darts-match')
        .on('broadcast', { event: 'update' }, (payload) => {
            const d = payload.payload;
            document.getElementById('p1-score').innerText = d.p1Score;
            document.getElementById('p2-score').innerText = d.p2Score;
            document.getElementById('p1-name').innerText = d.p1Name;
            document.getElementById('p2-name').innerText = d.p2Name;
            
            // Toggle "Active" highlight
            document.getElementById('p1-area').classList.toggle('active', d.active === 1);
            document.getElementById('p2-area').classList.toggle('active', d.active === 2);
        })
        .subscribe();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
Phase 2: The Scraper (Your PC)
This script runs in the background on your computer. It "pushes" the data to the link above.

Install requirements: npm install puppeteer @supabase/supabase-js

JavaScript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');

const supabase = createClient('URL', 'KEY');
const channel = supabase.channel('darts-match');

async function runScraper(watchCode) {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto(`https://tv.dartconnect.com/live/${watchCode}`);

    setInterval(async () => {
        const data = await page.evaluate(() => {
            return {
                p1Name: document.querySelector('#p1_name')?.innerText,
                p2Name: document.querySelector('#p2_name')?.innerText,
                p1Score: document.querySelector('#p1_score')?.innerText,
                p2Score: document.querySelector('#p2_score')?.innerText,
                active: document.querySelector('#p1_row').classList.contains('active') ? 1 : 2
            };
        });
        
        // Broadcast the data to Supabase (which sends it to your GitHub link)
        channel.send({ type: 'broadcast', event: 'update', payload: data });
    }, 1000);
}

runScraper('YOUR_WATCH_CODE');
Phase 3: OBS Setup
Copy the Link: Once your GitHub Page is live, it will look like https://yourname.github.io/darts-overlay/.

Add Browser Source: In OBS, add a new Browser Source.

Paste URL: Use your GitHub link.

Size: Set it to 1920x1080 (the code above will sit in the bottom left).

Transparency: It will automatically be transparent where there is no code.

Summary of Workflow
Once: Set up the GitHub Repo and Supabase project.

Per Match: Update the watchCode in your local scraper script and run it.

In OBS: Just keep the Browser Source active; it will update as soon as the scraper starts sending data.

is this possible to add to my tournament program with a tab for score board and user would input the match watch code and then the program would create a open url button that would open the githubpage url with the match watch id code and show the score board for my live stream would the server run in this program once its a exe file in the future

Absolutely! You can turn this into a professional, self-contained tournament application. By using URL Parameters, you can make one single GitHub link work for any match simply by attaching the watch code to the end of the URL.

Here is how we can structure this to be a "one-click" experience for your tournament users.

1. The Dynamic Scoreboard (GitHub Pages)
You don't need a separate page for every match. You can update your index.html to automatically "listen" to whatever match code is in the URL.

The Link Format: https://yourname.github.io/darts-overlay/?match=WATCHCODE

The Code Update (Snippet):

JavaScript
// Automatically grab the match code from the browser's address bar
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const matchCode = urlParams.get('match'); 

// Only subscribe to the specific match channel
const channel = supabase.channel(`match-${matchCode}`)
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'update' }, (payload) => {
      // ... update the scores ...
  })
  .subscribe();
2. The Tournament Program (The EXE)
To make this a professional .exe file that handles the scraping in the background, you can use Electron or Tauri.

How the "EXE" would work:
Tab 1 (Tournament): Your existing tournament management.

Tab 2 (Live Scoreboard):

Input Box: User types in the DartConnect Watch Code.

"Start Scraper" Button: Launches the hidden Puppeteer browser to start feeding data to Supabase.

"Open Overlay" Button: Opens the user's default browser to your GitHub link with their specific code attached.

3. Packaging the Scraper into the EXE
Yes, the "server" (the scraper logic) will run inside the program. When you build the .exe:

Puppeteer: You would bundle a "portable" version of Chromium so the user doesn't have to install anything.

Supabase: The app will use its own API key to push the data.

Background Task: The scraper runs as a "worker" or "background process" inside your app, so as long as the EXE is open, the scoreboard stays live.
