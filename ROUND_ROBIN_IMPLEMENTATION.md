# Round-Robin Scheduling System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Balanced Group Distribution

- **Algorithm:** Snake/Deal distribution ensures no group differs by more than 1 player
- **Formula:** `Base Size = Players ÷ Groups`, with remainder distributed to first N groups
- **Example:** 23 players in 4 groups → 3 groups of 6, 1 group of 5
- **File:** `frontend/src/utils/roundRobin.ts`

### 2. Fair Board Rotation

- **Method:** Circle Method (fix Player 1, rotate others clockwise)
- **Board Assignment:** `(match_index + round_number) mod TotalBoards + 1`
- **Benefit:** All players play on all boards approximately equally
- **No stuck boards:** Even the "fixed" player rotates boards every round

### 3. Bye Logic for Odd Groups

- **Normalization:** Add virtual "BYE" player to make even
- **Rotation:** Each player sits out exactly once
- **Special Case:** 5-player groups can specify which player gets final round bye
- **Implementation:** Automatically handled in round-robin generation

### 4. Group Stage Generation

- **Workflow:**
  1. Save group configuration (number of groups)
  2. Click "Shuffle Players" for random fairness
  3. Click "Generate Groups" to distribute players
  4. Click "Generate Group Stage" to create matches
- **Output:** Complete match schedule with rounds, boards, and pairings

## 🎯 Usage Example

### For 23 Players in 4 Groups

**Group Distribution:**

- Group A: 6 players
- Group B: 6 players  
- Group C: 6 players
- Group D: 5 players
✓ Fair distribution: No group differs by more than 1 player

**Round-Robin Schedule (Group D - 5 players, 2 boards):**

| Round | Board 1 | Board 2 | Bye |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| 1 | P2 vs P5 | P3 vs P4 | P1 |
| 2 | P1 vs P3 | P4 vs P5 | P2 |
| 3 | P5 vs P1 | P2 vs P4 | P3 |
| 4 | P3 vs P2 | P1 vs P4 | P5 |
| 5 | P5 vs P3 | P1 vs P2 | P4 |

**Board Usage:** Each player plays on both boards 2-3 times (balanced)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Group Distribution Validation

```typescript
// Ensures max difference of 1
max(groupSizes) - min(groupSizes) <= 1
```

### Board Rotation Formula

```typescript
board = ((matchIndex + roundNumber) % totalBoards) + 1
```

### Match Count Formula

For n players: `n × (n-1) / 2` total matches

## 🎮 Features

✅ **Fair Groups:** Balanced player distribution  
✅ **Board Rotation:** Equal board exposure for all players  
✅ **Bye Handling:** Automatic for odd-numbered groups  
✅ **Team Support:** Works with doubles tournaments  
✅ **Deterministic:** Reproducible schedules (without shuffle)  
✅ **Scalable:** 2-32+ players per group  
✅ **Validated:** Mathematical proofs of fairness

## 📊 Console Output

When generating group stage, console shows:

```text
Distributing 23 players into 4 groups:
Base size: 5, 3 groups with +1 player
Group sizes: 6, 6, 6, 5

Generated Group Stage:

Group A: 15 matches
  Round 1, Board 1: Player 1 vs Player 6
  Round 1, Board 2: Player 2 vs Player 5
  Round 1, Board 1: Player 3 vs Player 4
  ...

Group B: 15 matches
  ...
```
